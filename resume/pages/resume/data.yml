    highlights:
      - A new team was formed comprising of 4 UI developers (me included), a QA resource and a UX designer to come up with a plan to refresh the UI while keeping all the existing features to reduce the learning curve for our users.
      - Angular 2 and Vue were the two candidates for the re-implementation, where Vue won with a clear margin.
      - Vue really amped up our time to completion and gave us room to get some additional features in.

      - Known issues from the existing version helped us avoid the same mistakes again.
      - Lead the effort with two more frontend developers onboard.
faq:
  - question: Frontend or Backend / Preferred set of skills?
    response: Since the beginning of my journey in the IT industry, Iʼve had a clear and focused goal - to learn as much as I can, keep pushing myself, and make things that I can take pride in. Which is why I donʼt limit myself as a programmer having a specified skillset. Iʼve learnt everything I know on the job, under immense work pressures, and am continuing to do so. From design to front-end coding, mobile applications and recently back-end distributed servers. Where people normally see challenges, I see opportunities.
  - question: Where do I see myself after a few years?
    response:
      I have the desire, the ambition, the right work ethic & the talent to be good in what I do.
      In a few years, ideally, I would love to be working on a startup of my own and try to change the world, one step at a time.
      If not, my desire is to work on a great product and adding value with my creative and technical knowledge.
